//Hooray!
//You found me!
//Why are you looking in this game's files, anyway?
//Personally, I'm not interested in this junk
//But hey, since you're here...
//I thought I'd tell you something
//Have you played Ally's New Life?
//I was in it, you know
//In fact, this game was built off of the new Ally update
//It's not done yet, but will be soon!
//I hope we'll be able to meet again, or the first time, I don't know...
//Anyway, I think I should give you a hint on where I am, when the update releases
//Only super players can get this, so listen up
//https://midnightfright.bandcamp.com/album/-
//Alright, until we meet again!
